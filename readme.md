# Wolfram Alpha - Chatterbox Skill

Use Wolfram Alpha for general knowledge questions

Ask general-knowledge queries of your Chatterbox device. 
If no other Skills can handle the Intent, Wolfram Alpha will be queried to see
 if it can find an answer. You'll be surprised by how much it knows!

Examples

    "How tall is Mount Everest?"
    "When was The Rocky Horror Picture Show released?"
    "What is Madonna's real name?"
    "What's 18 times 4?"
    "How many inches in a meter?"
